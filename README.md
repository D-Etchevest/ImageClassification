## Image classification
### last modified date 02/23/20

This project was about image classification, with a data set of over 16 GB of labeled images. Four seperate classifiers should be build:

Na√Øve Bayes
Random Forest
Deep Learning
Support Vector Machines

The models must take in images and their labels, then classify each image. All data and code must be on the cloud (EC2), model written only in R. The reporting should include hypothesis testing, Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Overfitting (AuC).
